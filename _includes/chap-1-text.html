        <p>From the outset, Michael Asher designed his work to facilitate human interaction.
            Even his early experimentations with the production of material art objects
            in the mid- 1960s called for subordinating the art object to its spatial and social
            contexts.1</p>
            <p>In fact, the material construction of these objects often hinged upon
            their mimicry of socially recognizable patterns of behavior. An initial case in
            point might be the minimalist checkers set that Asher displayed in the exhibition
            “A Collection of Limited Editions by Contemporary Artists” in The Egg and
            the Eye, the café that later became the Los Angeles Craft and Folk Art Museum,
            in his hometown of Los Angeles in the fall of 1966. This geometrically shaped
            game set consisted of round silver and black custom- machined chrome pieces
            on a cardboard playing surface purchased from a dime store (figures 0.1, 0.2).2
            While on display at The Egg and the Eye, Asher’s checkers were spotted by Donald
            Judd, who had appeared at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ( lacma) for
            a speaking engagement.3</p>
           <p> Judd ended up purchasing Asher’s checkers set, countersigning
            his honorarium check to Asher in compensation.4
            It is not difficult
            to imagine the arch- minimalist Judd appreciating the structurally immaculate
            repetition of geometric shapes, systematically ordered, one thing after another.
            Yet Asher’s checkers set was not simply an industrially produced compendium of
            minimal forms; it was also a game intended to facilitate human interaction: come
            and play, engage with the work.</p>
            <p>Now an artist whose site- specific installations connect people with meticulously
            organized museum and gallery situations, Asher withdrew from the production
            of material art objects shortly after completing his checkers sets. Since
            then, he has chosen to work through a process of subtraction, displacement,
            reemphasis, and replacement. He uses the objects, elements, and relations that
            pertain to the institutional site that has commissioned work from him. The resulting
            installations (none of which have titles) have ranged from material gallery
            interventions to institutional displacements; from highlighting social relations to
            archival compendia. Typically, Asher’s projects—most of them commissioned by </p>
        
        <p>museums, galleries, freestanding exhibitions, or foundations—address the given
            context of their exhibition directly and exclusively. Because his works engage
            with their existing environments, they most frequently cease to exist at the end
            of their exhibition, leaving no art object that can be reexhibited, preserved, circulated,
            or commodified.5</p>
           <p> This exceptional adherence to the 1960s conceptualist
            principles of dematerialization combines with an approach that Thomas
            Crow has called “strong site specificity”: Asher’s installations tend to disable the
            day- to- day functioning of the host institution, and therefore are barred from
            permanent material existence.6</p>
            <p>Any notion of permanence within Asher’s work
            is further challenged by his experiential approach to museum or gallery presentation,
            which addresses the viewer’s epistemological and emotional faculties
            simultaneously. His installations require, and draw from, whatever discursive
            knowledge a viewer may have regarding the operation of art institutions, while
            they simultaneously solicit individuated social and psychological responses.
            That Asher’s experiential site specificity continues to address the ideological
            debates that surround and influence current museum practices is clear in his
            project at lacma in 2000 and 2002.7</p>
            <p>The art museum of the early twenty- first
            century is a vastly different creature from the 1960s museums and galleries
            in which Asher started out. In addition to showcasing autonomous art objects,
            lacma—along with most American museums—now increasingly centralizes
            its visitors’ experience. In 2000, the museum had founded a division, entitled
            lacmalab, charged with producing exhibitions designed to reach specific audience
            groups—in particular, families with children.8</p>
            <p>Extending the museum’s
            pedagogical mission from interpreting singular works of art to producing exhibitions
            with a clear communicative agenda, the lacmalab initiative addressed
            the broad sociopolitical imperatives directed at museums by funding bodies
            and the public to redress past inequalities of cultural exclusivity. In the view of
            the museum, visitors had lost their claim to uniform art appreciation and had
            become socially defined individuals whose habits, opinions, dispositions, and
            reactions—what Pierre Bourdieu would call “cultural competencies”9
            —could be
            at least partially predicted, and whose particular sensibilities the museum sought
            to address as part of its core mission.</p>

        lacmalab inaugurated its activities in 2000 with an exhibition entitled “Made in California: now.” Asher was one of eleven contemporary Californian
        artists invited to make works engineered to “reach” younger museum visitors. Asher’s proposal, which involved reinstalling the paintings and sculptures in oneof lacma’s permanent collection galleries, echoed the artist’s persistent ten- dency to examine the ideological and contextual dimensions of the art world. Such mock-curatorial artistic projects were common by 2000, having been expeditiously incorporated into the art and museum worlds since the early 1990s.10 Asher was far more than a casual participant in this museum trend. In fact, his earlier projects, such as the 1979 George Washington relocation for the
        “73rd American Exhibition” at the Art Institute of Chicago, were foundational to it. His reinstallation proposal for lacma, then, could easily have relied on his seniority in the  eld by simply reiterating his past, already critically acclaimed, artistic strategies.</p>

        Reconstructing the Asher of Art History</b></p>
    <p>Although Asher has been labeled one of the most signi cant artists of his genera- tion, the art historical reception of his overall practice has ranged from obscurity to acclaim. The scarcity of critical attention to his work is evident from the fact that there are few extended accounts of his oeuvre. Thus far, there have been no retrospective exhibitions of his work; his commitment to the historical and contextual speci city of each work has led him to consistently decline invitations to reconstruct past projects. In Asher’s view, recreating a work would necessitate</p>
